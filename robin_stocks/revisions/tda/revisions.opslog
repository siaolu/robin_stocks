General Revisions Log:
Added type hinting: 
This improves code clarity and enables better IDE support, which can lead to fewer bugs and easier maintenance.

Refactored payload creation: A new create_payload function centralizes the logic for creating payload dictionaries, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

Simplified conditional statements: Particularly in the new create_payload function, making the code more concise and easier to read.

Updated docstrings: To reflect the changes and provide clearer documentation.

Recommended use of f-strings: For more readable and efficient string formatting, although not directly visible in this particular code.

Type hinting: Added throughout the module for better code clarity and IDE support.

Refactoring: Common operations have been extracted into separate functions:
(e.g., encrypt_data, decrypt_data, get_cipher_suite, get_pickle_path) to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

Improved error handling: 
custom AuthenticationError exception has been introduced for more specific error messaging.

Resource management: 
Context managers are now used for file operations to ensure proper resource handling.

Enhanced security: 
keyring library is now used to store the encryption passcode more securely.

Logging: 
Added logging throughout - better debugging / monitoring.
